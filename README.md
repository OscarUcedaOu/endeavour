# AngularEndeavour

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

For the project I used Bootstrap because I didn't have much time and I think it's the most common and easy to use.
The data returned by the API were too many, so I also used the destructuring of objects and only took the ones I wanted to show and optimize the project.


There is a language selector at the top, for the search engine you have to search:
- Title
- First Maker 

The pagination is 10 items per page.
If we click on info it takes us to the page with all the details about the ArtObjet.
At the top there is a button to return to the main page. 



Things I would have liked to do
Because of time and because I am not at the moment with the best computer equipment I have not been able to do a few things that I would have liked to do:

-Page with translations, the data that the API returns if translated but I would have liked to make the page multilingual.

-The styles I would have liked to be able to do them myself instead of having to use bootstrap.

-Make it more visual

-Code optimization

-Build a separate node server to cache the results.

-Better structuring in git, since I didn't follow any rules for uploading commits.
